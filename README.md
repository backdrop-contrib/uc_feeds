#  Ubercart Feeds

This module provides Feeds mappings for Ubercart items, including model, SKU, stock, prices, 
weight, weight units, and more.

It also adds the ability to include attribute mappings (which are added to the 
product after it has been created), both for the price and weight fields.

Attributes and Options must already exist in Ubercart.

## Notes

We ran this through Coder Upgrade and it worked for our use case. Others mentioned
that it worked for them as well.
